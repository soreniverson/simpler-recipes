# Simpler Recipes

> A clean, ad-free recipe extraction and browsing service with meal planning tools.

## What This Site Does

Simpler Recipes extracts recipes from cluttered food blogs and presents them in a clean, readable format. Users can paste any recipe URL to get just the essential information: ingredients, instructions, prep time, cook time, and servings.

## Core Features

### Recipe Extraction

### Meal Planning
Plan your weekly meals by adding recipes to each day. Navigate between weeks and organize by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert).
URL: https://simpler.recipes/plan

### Shopping List
Generate a shopping list from your meal plan. Items are automatically:
- Merged (same ingredients from multiple recipes combined)
- Categorized by grocery aisle (Produce, Meat, Dairy, Pantry, etc.)
- Checked against your pantry (items you already have are marked)

### Pantry
Track what ingredients you have on hand. When generating shopping lists, pantry items are automatically marked so you know what you already have.
