        "Roast the chicken breasts in a baking dish, uncovered, for 30-35 minutes in a preheated oven (190C/gas 5/fan oven 170C). To check if they are done, insert a sharp knife into the centre of a parcel and leave it for a few seconds, if the chicken is cooked the tip should feel very hot when you pull it out and touch it. The chicken should also feel very firm when pressed with the back of a fork.",
