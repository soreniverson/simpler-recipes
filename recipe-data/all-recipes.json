Give the water 4 or 5 fast stirs in one direction to make the water and eggs swirl in the water. The centrifugal force will make the yolks cook centred in the egg white (ie no thin broken egg white walls) (Note 4).",

        "1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and drained, or 1 ½ cups cooked chickpeas",
        "½ teaspoon baking soda (if you’re using canned chickpeas)",
        "¼ cup lemon juice (from 1 ½ to 2 lemons), more to taste",
        "1 medium-to-large clove garlic, roughly chopped",
        "½ teaspoon fine sea salt, to taste",
        "½ cup tahini",
        "2 to 4 tablespoons ice water, more as needed",

      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Place the chickpeas in a medium saucepan and add the baking soda. Cover the chickpeas by several inches of water, then bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Continue boiling, reducing heat if necessary to prevent overflow, for about 20 minutes, or until the chickpeas look bloated, their skins are falling off, and they’re quite soft. In a fine-mesh strainer, drain the chickpeas and run cool water over them for about 30 seconds. Set aside (no need to peel the chickpeas for this recipe!).",
        "Meanwhile, in a food processor or high-powered blender, combine the lemon juice, garlic and salt. Process until the garlic is very finely chopped, then let the mixture rest so the garlic flavor can mellow, ideally 10 minutes or longer.",
        "Add the tahini to the food processor and blend until the mixture is thick and creamy, stopping to scrape down any tahini stuck to the sides and bottom of the processor as necessary.",
        "While running the food processor, drizzle in 2 tablespoons ice water. Scrape down the food processor, and blend until the mixture is ultra smooth, pale and creamy. (If your tahini was extra-thick to begin with, you might need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water.)",
        "Add the cumin and the drained, over-cooked chickpeas to the food processor. While blending, drizzle in the olive oil. Blend until the mixture is super smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor as necessary, about 2 minutes. Add more ice water by the tablespoon if necessary to achieve a super creamy texture.",
        "Taste, and adjust as necessary—I almost always add another ¼ teaspoon salt for more overall flavor and another tablespoon of lemon juice for extra zing.",
        "Scrape the hummus into a serving bowl or platter, and use a spoon to create nice swooshes on top. Top with garnishes of your choice, and serve. Leftover hummus keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 1 week."

        "In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until the mixture is light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined. The dough should be soft. If it seems too soft and sticky for rolling, beat in 1 more Tablespoon of flour.",
        "Divide the dough in half. Place each portion on a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use a bit more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4 inch thick.",
        "Lightly dust one of the rolled-out dough portions with flour. (This prevents sticking.) Place the second rolled-out dough portion, still on the parchment paper, on top of the first. Cover the dough tightly and  refrigerate it for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.",
        "Carefully remove the top piece of dough from the refrigerator. If it’s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Gather the scraps, reroll, and continue cutting until all the dough is used. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you reroll.) Repeat with the second piece of dough. Arrange the cookies 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.",
        "Bake for 11–12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are very lightly browned and set. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheets halfway through bake time. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before decorating.",
        "Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing, easy cookie icing, or cookie decorating buttercream. Feel free to tint any of the icings with gel food coloring. See post above for recommended decorating tools. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it’s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting.",
        "Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or shipping. Store plain or iced cookies covered tightly at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days. If decorated with cookie buttercream, cover and store decorated cookies at room temperature for up to 1 day, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."

Whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved. Pour mixture into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir with a sturdy rubber spatula or wooden spoon OR use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed. Mix until a soft dough forms.",

Roll up the dough to make a 14-inch log. Cut into 10–12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9- or 10-inch round cake pan, pie dish, or square baking pan.",
        "Cover the pan with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the rolls to rise in a relatively warm environment for 60–90 minutes or until double in size. (For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
        "After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 24–27 minutes, or until lightly browned. If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking. If you want to be precise about their doneness, their internal temperature taken with an instant read thermometer should be around 195–200°F (91–93°C) when done. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack as you make the icing. (You can also make the icing as the rolls bake.)",
        "In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add the butter and beat until smooth and combined, then beat in the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until combined. Using a knife or icing spatula, spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately.",

        "2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1.3 lbs. total)* ($6.49)",
        "1/2 tsp Italian seasoning ($0.05)",
        "1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)",
        "1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)",
        "1/4 cup all-purpose flour ($0.06)",
        "2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)",
        "2 Tbsp butter, divided ($0.27)",
        "1 whole garlic bulb (about 8-9 garlic cloves)** ($0.64)",
        "1 cup chicken broth ($0.17)",
        "3/4 cup heavy cream ($1.08)",
        "1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)",
        "Salt and Pepper to taste ($0.04)"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Using a sharp knife, carefully fillet each chicken breast into two thinner cutlets (or use thin-cut chicken breasts).",
        "Season each breast with Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Then sprinkle the flour over both sides of the chicken breasts and rub it in until the chicken is evenly coated.",
        "Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and 1 Tbsp of butter. Once the skillet is hot, add the chicken and cook on each side until golden brown and cooked through (about 4 minutes per side). Remove the cooked chicken to a clean plate and cover to keep warm.",
        "While the chicken is cooking, peel the garlic cloves and then carefully smash them with the side of a large chef's knife by pressing down on the side of the knife with the heel of your hand.",
        "Once the chicken is removed, to the same skillet add the remaining 1 Tbsp of butter, then add the garlic cloves. Turn the heat down to medium-low and sauté the garlic for 3 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant. Make sure to stir the garlic frequently to prevent it from burning.",
        "Next pour the chicken broth and heavy cream into the skillet, then add the garlic powder. Stir and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer in the skillet for 8-10 minutes, or until it has reduced and thickened by about 50%. Taste the sauce at this point and add salt and pepper if needed (I added about ⅛ tsp of salt and ⅛ tsp of black pepper).",
        "Finally, return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet and spoon the creamy sauce over top. Allow the chicken to heat through. Serve with fresh chopped parsley (optional), and enjoy!"

Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.",

        "Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender, being sure not to fill past the maximum fill line (blend in batches if necessary). Add the beans, butter, sugar, and several twists of black pepper. Securely fasten the lid and blend the soup until smooth, being careful to avoid hot steam escaping from the lid.",
        "Since canned tomatoes vary in flavor, I always end up tinkering with this soup a bit at the end. Taste and, if necessary, add a little more sugar (to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes), pepper, and salt (I usually add another ¼ to ½ teaspoon).",
        "If you’re adding basil, add it now. Briefly blend again, and serve hot. This soup keeps well for up to four days or so. You can freeze leftovers for up to 3 months."

Bring to simmer and then adjust the heat down to the lowest heat possible to maintain a bare simmer when covered (we cook our roast on the warm setting of our electric range). (If cooking in the oven, bring to a simmer first on the stovetop, then put in the oven, start the temp at 350°F for 15 minutes, then drop it to 250°F for the next hour, and then to 225°F after that.)",

If your pot roast is too dry, make sure the pan you are using has a tight fitting lid and that you are cooking at the lowest possible heat to maintain the low simmer.

However, leftovers can be kept for up to 5 days refrigerated and can be reheated in the microwave. To reheat , warm individual portions in 1-minute bursts in the microwave until warmed through. The sauce can be drizzled over top and reheated along with the individual slice. We do not recommend freezing bread pudding. Did you love the recipe? Give us some stars and leave a comment below!"

        "1/2 tsp white vinegar (Note 2)",
        "Raspberry Coulis",
        "Lemon Curd (uses the 3 leftover yolks from the Pav)",
        "(See in post for other options (- passionfruit pulp, pureed mango, chopped up fruit, chocolate sauce!))",
        "1 cup heavy/thickened cream ((or any other whipping cream), COLD)",
        "1 1/2 tbsp caster sugar / superfine sugar",
        "1/2 tsp vanilla extract",
        "Option to stabilise (so you can whip cream day before - see here for how (Note 3))",

        "5 mint sprigs (small)",
        "20 raspberries",

      "instructions": [
        "Pipe then shape meringues into 5 domes. Bake 1 1/2 hours at 110°C/225°F (100°C fan), cool 3 hours / overnight in oven. Cut small hole in Pav bomb base, squidge around with chopstick to make room for fillings. Fill with coulis then curd, plug hole with cream. Decorate, SMASH!",
        "Preheat oven to 150°C / 325°F (all oven types).",
        "Egg whites - Separate the egg yolks from egg whites while fridge cold (it's easier). Measure out 1/3 cup (80 ml) egg whites then set aside to come to room temperature for 15 minutes (fluffs better at room temp).",
        "Add sugar - In a stand mixer or using an electric beater, beat the egg whites on high for 1 minute. While still beating, slowly pour the sugar in over 1 minute.",
        "Beat 5 minutes - Continue to beat for 5 minutes on high until it's fluffy, glossy, and there are no sugar grains remaining when you rub a bit between your fingers. Add vinegar and cornflour then beat for a further 30 seconds.",
        "Line tray - Dab a bit on the corner of 2 trays then cover with baking paper (parchment).",
        "Pipe mounds Transfer meringue mixture into a large piping bag. Snip the end to make a large 2cm / 0.8\" hold. Pipe 5 mounds on the tray, then smooth into domes that are taller than they are wide (they flatten slightly when baked). Mine are about 4 cm / 1.6\" wide and 6.5cm /2.6\" tall. Use a small offset spatula or butter knife to smooth into a dome shape (no need to be perfect, it gets decorated later).",
        "Bake 1 hour 30 minutes - Place both trays in the oven, immediately turn oven DOWN to 110°C/225°F (100°C fan) and bake for 1 hour 30 minutes or until they are dry to touch (check base). Keep baking if still sticky - exact times may vary. (Note 4)",
        "Cool in oven - Turn oven OFF and leave to fully cool for 3 hours or overnight around 10 hours (I often do this while I sleep so handy!).",
        "Make the Lemon Curd and Raspberry Coulis while the pavlovas are in the oven. Very easy - simmer to thicken, strain, then chill before using.",
        "Whipped cream - Beat cream ingredients in a large bowl on high until soft peaks form (45 seconds using a stand mixer, 1 - 1 1/2 minutes with hand held beater). Do this just prior to serving, unless you stabilise the cream (which can be done the day before). Note: if making stabilised whipped cream, follow the steps for your chosen method (there's multiple ways to do it).",
        "Piping bags - Transfer the raspberry coulis, lemon curd and cream into separate piping bags. Snip a small 5 mm / 1/5\" off the end of the raspberry coulis, and a larger 1cm / 0.4\" off the cream piping bag. (No piping bag? See Note 5)",
        "Access hole! Place a pavlova bomb upside down in a muffin tin, to hold in place as you work. Carefully cut a 1cm / 0.4\" hole in the middle using a small sharp knife. Stick a chopstick into the hole and squidge around GENTLY to move some pavlova marshmallow centre out of the way to make room for the fillings.",
        "Pipe some raspberry coulis in (~ 1 1/2 tsp), then lemon curd (~ 2 - 3 tsp). Plug the hole with cream.",
        "Plate up - Pipe ~2 tbsp cream on a plate, top with pavlova bomb (stops it from sliding). Pipe then spread more cream on the top of the pavlova bomb. Top with a raspberry, mint sprig, sprinkle of pistachio, dust with icing sugar.",
        "Smash! Serve immediately - pavs don't wait around once assembled! Encourage everyone to smash into their Pavlova Bombs so you get a bit of everything in your first bite - delicate crispy meringue, marshmallow centre, tangy lemon curd, bright raspberry coulis. SWOON!"

Do not even check the chicken for at least an hour. After an hour, check the chicken and refresh the coals if needed (if you are using a charcoal grill). Keep checking the chicken every 15 minutes or so, until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165°F. The total cooking time will vary depending on the size of your chicken, and the internal temperature of the grill. A 4-pound chicken will usually take around 1 1/2 hours. If you don't have a meat thermometer, a way to tell if the chicken is done is to poke it deeply with a knife (the thigh is a good place to do this), if the juices run clear, not pink, the chicken is done.",
        "I say \"carefully\" because the beer can, and the beer inside of it, is quite hot. One way to do this is to slide a metal spatula under the bottom of the beer can. Use tongs to hold the top of the chicken. Lift the chicken, beer can still inside, and move it to a tray. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. Carefully lift the chicken off of the can. If it gets stuck, lay the chicken on its side, and pull out the can with tongs. Did you love the recipe? Give us some stars and leave a comment below!"

        "To cook the eggplant, broil or grill the rounds. You could also fry the eggplant rounds but they tend to absorb a lot of oil that way. To grill the eggplant rounds, get a grill very hot and close the lid. Paint one side of the eggplant rounds with olive oil and grill 2-3 minutes. When they are done on one side, paint the other side with oil and flip. When the eggplants are nicely grilled, set aside. To broil, line a broiling pan or roasting pan with aluminum foil. Paint with olive oil. Place the eggplant rounds on the foil and brush with olive oil. Broil for 3-4 minutes until lightly browned on one side, then flip them over and broil for a few minutes more. Set aside."

        "To serve, double up the tortillas and place a few spoonfuls of the carnitas on them. Top with salsa. To eat, remove half of the carnitas from one tortilla to another. Take one tortilla at a time with the carnitas and salsa, fold it over and enjoy. Or, keep them doubled up. Your choice."

      "ingredients": [
        "2 1/2 cups dry pinto beans (about 1 pound or 450g)",
        "Water",
        "2 teaspoons salt (less or more to taste)",
        "2 teaspoons dried oregano, or a large sprig fresh oregano",
        "1 onion, halved",
        "2 tablespoons (or more to taste) bacon fat or extra virgin olive oil",
        "1/2 cup bean cooking liquid or water",
        "1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder, optional",
        "Crumbled cotija cheese or grated cheddar cheese, optional"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Rinse the beans in water and check for and remove any small stones, pieces of dirt, or bad beans. Remove any beans that float in water.",
        "Stove Top Method Put beans into a pot and cover with at least 3 inches of water—about 3 quarts total for 2 1/2 cups of dry beans. Add half an onion, salt, and oregano. Bring to a boil and then lower heat to simmer, covered, for about 2 1/2 hours. The cooking time will vary depending on the batch of beans you have. The beans are done when they are soft and the skin is just beginning to break open. If the beans are still hard after 2 1/2 hours, add 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda to the pot and cook a half hour or more longer. Pressure Cooker Method Put beans into a 4 quart or larger Instant Pot or pressure cooker with a 15 pound weight. Add 8 cups (2 quarts) of water. (Make sure you never fill a pressure cooker with water more than 2/3 of the way up the pot.) Add half an onion, the salt, and oregano. Cook for 30 to 35 minutes on high pressure, then let the beans cool naturally for 10 minutes before releasing the pressure valve. The beans should be soft and the skins barely breaking open. If the beans are still quite hard, add 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda and bring to pressure again for 10 minutes. Note: If you are using a standard pressure cooker (not an Instant Pot), allow the pressure cooker to cool completely before opening. If there is resistance when attempting to open the cooker, do not open it, allow it to cool further. Follow the directions for your brand of pressure cooker. (See How to Make Fast No Soak Beans in a Pressure Cooker .) Either method: Strain the beans from the cooking water, reserving about a cup of the cooking water. Remove the remnants of onion or oregano sprig if using.",
        "Chop the remaining half an onion. Heat the bacon fat or oil in a wide, sturdy frying pan (not a flimsy nonstick) on medium high heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent. (You can do this while the beans are cooking.)",
        "Add the strained beans and about a 1/4 cup of the bean cooking water or plain water to the pan. Using a potato masher, mash the beans in the pan, while you are cooking them, until they are a rough purée.",
        "Add more bean water or plain water to desired level of creaminess and to keep the fried beans from getting too dried out. Add more salt to taste. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder, if using. When the beans are heated through, top with crumbled cotija cheese or shredded cheddar cheese (1/2 cup) to serve (optional). (You can also stir in slices of cheddar to melt into the hot beans.) Did you enjoy this recipe? Let us know with a rating and review!"

Flip and cook 1 to 2 minutes longer if needed; the fish is done when it is opaque all the way through and breaks apart easily. If any smaller, thinner pieces of the fish start to break off as you flip, just scoop them out and transfer them to a serving platter.",

        "In a separate, very clean bowl with clean beaters, whip together the egg whites and the salt on medium-high speed until the whites are foamy. Once the whites look foamy, gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon of sugar to the egg whites. Continue whipping until the whites are stiff and glossy, about 4 1/2 minutes. The whites should stand up with a peak that folds over just slightly when the beaters are pulled from their surface.",
        "Working quickly to prevent the eggs from deflating, sift half of the cake flour into the bowl with the yolks. Use a wide rubber spatula to gently fold the flour into the yolks. Once the flour has been incorporated, fold in half of the egg whites gently so as not to deflate the eggs. Repeat again with the remaining flour and whites.",
        "Fill the prepared cake pan with the cake batter and use an offset spatula to spread the batter evenly into the pan. Gently tap the pan against the countertop a couple of times to release any air bubbles that may be trapped in the batter.",
        "Bake until the top is golden brown and springs back quickly when pressed with your fingertip, about 15 minutes. Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan, or turn it out onto a deep, rimmed serving platter.",
        "In a large pitcher or bowl, combine the 3 milks, the brandy (if using), and the vanilla extract. Whisk together until combined.",
        "Once the cake has cooled, use a toothpick or the tines of a fork to poke small holes all over the cake. Pour the milk mixture over the cake, covering it entirely. Don’t worry if it seems to be a lot; the cake will soak up virtually all of the milk as it sits. Cover the cake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 24 hours.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream with an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed. Once the beaters begin to leave ribbons in the cream, stop the mixer and then add the vanilla extract and the powdered sugar. Increase the speed to high, and whip until the cream is thick and holds its shape when the beaters are removed, roughly 5 to 7 minutes.",
        "Spread the whipped cream in an even layer over the top of the cake using an offset spatula. Sprinkle with a liberal dusting of ground cinnamon.",
        "Refrigerate the cake up to three hours until ready to serve. Cut into 12 squares. Enjoy up to 3 days after preparation—keep it refrigerated."

At this point, stir or toss with a wooden spoon so the mince browns and caramelises all over. If the pan becomes too dry, add a drizzle more oil. When the mince is well toasted, sprinkle over the taco seasoning and cook for 2 mins, then stir through the tomato purée and pour over the rest of the lime juice and let it sizzle for another minute. Stir through the black beans and turn up the heat to medium, continuing to cook until everything is hot. Taste for seasoning, then set aside.",

Top with the avocado slices, chopped tomato, pickled red onions, along with any juices, and the feta. Drizzle with the dressing, then finally scatter over the coriander.

        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the butternut squash on the pan and drizzle each half with just enough olive oil to lightly coat the squash on the inside (about ½ teaspoon each). Rub the oil over the inside of the squash and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.",
        "Turn the squash face down and roast until it is tender and completely cooked through, about 40 to 50 minutes (don’t worry if the skin or flesh browns—that’s good for flavor). Set the squash aside until it’s cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, in a large soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering (if your blender has a soup preset, use a medium skillet to minimize dishes.) Add the chopped shallot and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot has softened and is starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring frequently. Transfer the contents to your stand blender (see notes on how to use an immersion blender instead).",
        "Use a large spoon to scoop the butternut squash flesh into your blender. Discard the tough skin. Add the maple syrup, nutmeg and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper to the blender. Pour in 3 cups vegetable broth, being careful not to fill the container past the maximum fill line (you can work in batches if necessary, and stir in any remaining broth later).",
        "Securely fasten the lid. Blend on high (or select the soup preset, if available), being careful to avoid hot steam escaping from the lid. Stop once your soup is ultra creamy and warmed through.",
        "If you would like to thin out your soup a bit more, stir in the remaining cup of broth. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil, to taste, and blend well. Taste and stir in more salt and pepper, if necessary.",
        "If your soup is piping hot from the blending process, you can pour it into serving bowls. If not, pour it back into your soup pot and warm the soup over medium heat, stirring often, until it’s nice and steamy. I like to top individual bowls with some extra black pepper."

        "1 tablespoon (loose) of fresh thyme (can also use a few sprigs of fresh thyme) OR 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme (more to taste)",

      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Peel and thinly slice the onions from root to stem. There should be about 10 cups of sliced onions in total.",
        "In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the onions and toss to coat with the olive oil. Cook the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15 to 20 minutes. Increase the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and the butter and cook, stirring often, until the onions start to brown, about 20 to 40 minutes. The amount of time will vary depending on your pot, stove, and onions.",
        "Sprinkle with sugar (to help with the caramelization) and 1 teaspoon of salt. Continue to cook until the onions are well browned, about 10 to 15 more minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.",
        "Add the wine or vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits on the bottom and sides of the pot, deglazing the pot as you go.",
        "Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes.",
        "Season to taste with more salt and add freshly ground black pepper. Discard the bay leaves. Add brandy if using.",
        "While the soup is simmering, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil and preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Brush both sides of the French bread or baguette slices lightly with olive oil (you'll end up using about a tablespoon and a half of olive oil for this). Put in the oven and toast until lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven. Turn the toasts over and sprinkle with the grated Gruyere cheese and Parmesan. Return to oven when it's close to serving time and bake until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.",
        "To serve, ladle soup into a bowl and transfer one cheesy toast onto the top of each bowl of soup. Alternatively, you can use individual oven-proof bowls or one large casserole dish. Ladle the soup into the bowls or casserole dish. Cover with the toast and sprinkle with cheese. Put into the broiler for 10 minutes at 350° F, or until the cheese bubbles and is slightly browned.

The steaming water may foam up a bit; just watch so it doesn't overflow. Use a slotted spoon to remove the clams from the pot to a bowl. Strain the remaining clam steaming liquid through a fine mesh sieve to catch any grit and reserve. You should have 2 to 3 cups of clam liquid. Separate the clams from the clam shells. Discard the shells. Roughly chop the cooked clams. You should have 1 1/2 to 2 cups of chopped clams.",
        "Place the salt pork and butter or oil in the bottom of a large, thick-bottomed pot. Heat on medium and brown the salt pork. (Note that if you are using salt pork that is mostly fat, you won't need any additional fat from butter or oil, but you might want to put a little water in the pan to help render the fat from the salt pork.)",
        "Add the chopped onion to the pan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.",
        "Sprinkle flour over the onions and stir until everything is coated with the flour. Let the flour cook for a minute or two. Slowly add the white wine to the pot, stirring after each addition.",
        "Add potatoes to the pot. Add 2 to 3 cups of the strained clam steaming liquid and a cup of water. The liquid should cover the potatoes. If not, add a little more water or clam cooking liquid. Add the bay leaf, thyme, black pepper, and Old Bay. Heat to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, then add the corn (if using) and cook for 5 minutes more, or until the potatoes are cooked through.",
        "While the potatoes are cooking, heat a cup of cream in a small saucepan until steamy.",
        "When the potatoes are tender, add the chopped clams and turn off the heat under the soup. Slowly stir in the heated cream. Adjust seasonings. Stir in the fresh parsley. Note that if you simmer the soup after the cream has been added, the soup may curdle. This is why we turn off the heat before adding the hot cream. Serve with oyster crackers or rustic bread.

        "Add the chicken stock to a medium pot and bring it up to a gentle simmer.",
        "In a large (8-quart or larger) thick-bottomed pot, heat the butter or olive oil over medium-high heat. Pat dry the chicken pieces and sprinkle with salt. Working in batches, brown the chicken pieces, placing the pieces skin-side down first; this will render out fat you will use to build the stew later.",
        "Once the chicken pieces are browned on all sides, remove them from the large pot, and turn off the heat. Remove and discard the skin from the chicken pieces and put the chicken pieces into the pot of simmering stock. Poach the chicken in the stock until cooked through, about 20 minutes or so. Remove the chicken pieces and set on a tray to cool for a few minutes. When the chicken pieces are cool to touch, pull the meat off the bones and cut into 2-inch chunks. Set aside.",
        "Return the heat on the large pot to medium-high. When the pot is hot, add the onion, celery, carrot and thyme and sauté until soft, but not browned, about 4 to 5 minutes.",
        "Add the flour and stir well. The flour will absorb the fat in the pot and will stick a little to the bottom. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the flour vegetable mixture constantly for 2 to 3 minutes. Do not let it burn.",
        "Get a ladle ready and have the pot of simmering chicken stock nearby. Add the sherry to the flour vegetable mixture. It will sputter and seize up. Add a ladle of hot chicken stock and stir well. It will be goopy. Add another ladle, then another, stirring all the while, until the broth comes together. Add the rest of the chicken stock and the reserved chicken meat. Increase the heat and bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer while you make the dumplings.",
        "Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add (optional) chopped fresh herbs. Add melted butter and milk to the dry ingredients. Gently mix with a wooden spoon until mixture just comes together. (Note: do not over-mix or your dumplings will turn out too dense.)",
        "Drop dumpling batter into the simmering stew by heaping teaspoonfuls, over the surface of the stew. (Note that the dumplings will easily double in size as they cook.) Cover and simmer until dumplings are cooked through, about 15 minutes. Once you have covered the pan, do not uncover and peek while the dumplings are cooking! In order for the dumplings to be light and fluffy, they must steam, not boil. Uncovering the pan releases the steam. If after 15 minutes the dumplings are still not cooked through (use a toothpick or skewer to test), then cover pan again and cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Gently stir in peas, parsley, and cream, if using. Add salt and pepper to taste. Ladle portions of meat, sauce, vegetables, and dumplings into soup plates and serve. Note that the stew will continue to thicken the longer it sits. Did you love the recipe? Give us some stars and leave a comment below!"
